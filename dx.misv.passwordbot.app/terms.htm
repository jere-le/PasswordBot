            agreement is personal to you and, except with our consent, you may not
            transfer or assign to any other person (in other words, make another
            person legally responsible for) the rights granted by, or your
            obligation to comply with, these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
            Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            If a court or similar body determines that a portion of these Terms of
            Use is invalid or unenforce¬able, the rest of the Terms of Use should
            stand. The invalid or unenforceable portion should be interpreted as
            closely as possible (consistent with the law in your area) so as to
            reflect the intention of the original.<br> These Terms of Use are
            not intended to benefit any third party, and do not create any third
            party beneficiaries. Accordingly, these Terms of Use may only be
            invoked or enforced by you or us.
        </p>
        <p>
            YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, YOU
            WAIVE (IN OTHER WORDS, GIVE UP) THE RIGHT TO COMMENCE ANY PROCEEDING
            AGAINST US IF THE RELEVANT EVENTS OCCURRED MORE THAN ONE YEAR EARLIER.
            THIS WAIVER IS NOT ENFORCEABLE, AND THE NORMAL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
            IN YOUR AREA WILL APPLY, IF YOU NOTIFIED US IN WRITING OF THE EVENTS
            GIVING RISE TO THE PROCEEDING WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR OCCURRENCE.
